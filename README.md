# Discord Bot Support

If you would like to allow a moderator to get direct access to your server's commands, you may want to set up a Discord bot on your server.

The setup is very simple, all you need is a Discord App Token and a role on your server.
Both can be specified in the config within the file.

After this is complete just run the `console-discord.js` file in the `run` folder and your server will start along with the bot.
